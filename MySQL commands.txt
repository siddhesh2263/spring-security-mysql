MySQL error code: 1175 during UPDATE in MySQL Workbench
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11448068/mysql-error-code-1175-during-update-in-mysql-workbench)

No need to set SQL_SAFE_UPDATES to 0, I would really discourage it to do it that way. SAFE_UPDATES is by default on for a REASON. You can drive a car without safety belts and other things if you know what I mean ;) Just add in the WHERE clause a KEY-value that matches everything like a primary-key comparing to 0, so instead of writing:

DELETE FROM user WHERE (user_name = 'user' AND id <> 0);
